He consistently worked hard to bring his ideas to life, which ultimately led Microsoft to become one of the most influential tech companies in the world. Gates' approach shows us that setting clear goals and putting in consistent effort are critical steps toward success.

Despite his billionaire status, Bill Gates leads a life of simplicity. Whether it's his modest choice of clothing or his approach to spending, Gates chooses substance over materialism. He believes that success doesn't come from luxury but from focusing on important aspects of life, such as knowledge, relationships, and giving back. This habit of simple living with high thinking gives the idea that true fulfilment comes from pursuing one's passion and contributing to society, rather than from material possessions. By adopting these habits from Bill Gates, individuals can not only improve their productivity but also lead a more purpose-driven life.
